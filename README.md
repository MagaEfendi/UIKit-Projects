## UIKit Projects

This repository contains two projects developed using the UIKit framework: Bankey app and Password Reset.

## Bankey App

The Bankey app is a simple banking application that allows users to manage their bank accounts. The app features a login screen where users can authenticate with their account credentials, and once logged in, they can view their account balance and transaction history. Users can also transfer money to other accounts and manage their profile information.

## Password Reset

The Password Reset project is a small utility app that demonstrates how to reset a user's password. The app features a login screen where users can enter their account credentials. If the user has forgotten their password, they can tap on the "Forgot Password" button, which will prompt them to enter their email address. The app will then send an email to the user's email address with instructions on how to reset their password.

## What I Have Learned

Developing these two projects using the UIKit framework has taught me a lot about iOS app development. I have learned how to create user interfaces using various UIKit components such as buttons, labels, text fields, and table views. I have also learned how to use various UIKit APIs to handle user interactions, network requests, and data persistence. Additionally, I have learned how to use Auto Layout to create responsive user interfaces that can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.

Overall, developing these two projects has been a great learning experience, and I look forward to applying the skills and knowledge that I have gained to future iOS app development projects.
