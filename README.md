## UIKit Projects

This repository contains two projects developed using the UIKit framework: Bankey app and Password Reset.

## Bankey App

The Bankey app is a simple banking application that allows users to manage their bank accounts. The app features a login screen where users can authenticate with their account credentials, and once logged in, they can view their account balance and transaction history. Users can also transfer money to other accounts and manage their profile information.

## Password Reset

The Password Reset project is a small utility app that demonstrates how to reset a user's password. The app features a login screen where users can enter their account credentials. If the user has forgotten their password, they can tap on the "Forgot Password" button, which will prompt them to enter their email address. The app will then send an email to the user's email address with instructions on how to reset their password.

##Spotify Player

The Spotify Player project is a music player app that allows users to listen to their favorite songs from Spotify. The app features a login screen where users can authenticate with their Spotify account credentials. Once logged in, users can browse their playlists and play their favorite songs. The app also allows users to search for songs, artists, and albums and create new playlists.

## What I Have Learned

Through the development of these projects, I have gained practical experience with various aspects of iOS app development, including:

- Designing and implementing user interfaces using UIKit components such as buttons, labels, text fields, table views, and collection views
- Building responsive and adaptable user interfaces with Auto Layout and Size Classes
- Integrating network calls with RESTful APIs to retrieve and display data in real-time
- Implementing user authentication and authorization using OAuth2 and Keychain services
- Storing and retrieving data locally with Core Data and UserDefaults
- Creating custom views and animations using Core Animation and UIViewPropertyAnimator
- Implementing push notifications using Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)
- Creating custom protocols and delegates to facilitate communication between components and modules
- Writing unit tests using XCTest to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase
- Collaborating with other developers using Git and GitHub to manage code changes and version control.
Overall, these projects have provided me with a solid foundation in iOS app development and have helped me to develop essential skills and expertise that will be valuable for future projects.
