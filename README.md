## UIKit Projects

This repository contains two projects developed using the UIKit framework: Bankey app and Password Reset.

## Bankey App

The Bankey app is a simple banking application that allows users to manage their bank accounts. The app features a login screen where users can authenticate with their account credentials, and once logged in, they can view their account balance and transaction history. Users can also transfer money to other accounts and manage their profile information.

## Password Reset

The Password Reset project is a small utility app that demonstrates how to reset a user's password. The app features a login screen where users can enter their account credentials. If the user has forgotten their password, they can tap on the "Forgot Password" button, which will prompt them to enter their email address. The app will then send an email to the user's email address with instructions on how to reset their password.

## Spotify App

The Spotify App project is a music player app that allows users to listen to their favorite songs from Spotify. The app features a login screen where users can authenticate with their Spotify account credentials. Once logged in, users can browse their playlists and play their favorite songs. The app also allows users to search for songs, artists, and albums and create new playlists.

## Starbucks App

The Starbucks App is an application that provides users with the ability to order coffee and customize their beverages. It includes features such as browsing the menu, selecting preferred options, placing orders, and locating nearby Starbucks stores. Users can also manage their payment methods and view order history.

## What I Have Learned

Throughout the development of these projects, I have acquired valuable knowledge and skills in iOS app development:

Designing user interfaces using various UIKit components, including buttons, labels, text fields, table views, and collection views.
Creating responsive and adaptive layouts using Auto Layout and Size Classes to ensure proper display across different device sizes and orientations.
Integrating with RESTful APIs to retrieve and display real-time data, such as account balances, transaction history, and music tracks.
Implementing secure authentication and authorization using OAuth2 and Keychain services to protect user data.
Utilizing local data storage techniques such as Core Data and UserDefaults for efficient data management and persistence.
Creating custom views and animations using Core Animation and UIViewPropertyAnimator to enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the app.
Implementing push notifications using Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) to engage users with timely updates and promotions.
Establishing communication between components and modules through custom protocols and delegates for seamless interaction and data transfer.
Applying version control with Git and GitHub to facilitate collaboration, track code changes, and manage project milestones.

These projects have provided me with a strong foundation in iOS app development, enabling me to create engaging and functional applications while incorporating best practices and industry-standard techniques.
